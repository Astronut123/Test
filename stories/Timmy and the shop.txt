Once apon a time, A little boy named Timmy went to the store. Jen, Timmy's Mom gave him $200 to spend. She said he can get only 1 electronic and the rest on other stuff, also batteries are not counted as electronics as her. So he can get 1 electronic and other stuff like batteries or food. She came with Timmy to Walmart. He looked in the toys Ile. He saw something and thought it was SO cute looking in the box. It was a Furby Connect. He got it! And some batteries... Like 300 duracell batteries and 1 philip screwdriver. They bought them!
